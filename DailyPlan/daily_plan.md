# 12-week Day-by-day DS&A Plan (Days 1–84)

This file lists daily topics, focus areas, and a short practice target for each day (2–4 problems or small implementation tasks). Follow the daily schedule, update `tracker.md` as you finish items, and add solutions to `solutions/`.

Notes:
- Target per day: 2–4 problems (1–2 easy, 1 medium). On heavy-topic days (DP/graphs) aim for 1–2 focused medium problems with thorough postmortem.
- Timebox: Try at least one timed problem daily (30–60 min). Weekly timed sets are also included.

If you want, I can:
- Populate each day with curated LeetCode (or other) links and difficulty tags into this file.
- Create a companion CSV/JSON with day → problem links for automated tracking.

Tell me which you prefer next: (A) populate all 84 days with problem links, (B) populate Week 1 links only, or (C) export the plan to CSV for spreadsheet tracking.
