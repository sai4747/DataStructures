% Data Structures & Algorithms Interview Preparation Plan

This plan is a 12-week, practical roadmap to prepare for technical interviews (coding + problem solving). It focuses on building concepts, practicing problems with increasing difficulty, timed practice, and mock interviews. Use the accompanying tracker (`tracker.md`) to log progress and the `solutions/` folder for code templates and solved problems.

Goals / Success Criteria
- Be able to confidently solve 80% of medium LeetCode problems relevant to common interview topics.
- Complete at least 200 curated problems (mix of easy/medium/hard) with explanations.
- Pass 6-8 timed mock interviews with peers or platforms and receive actionable feedback.

High-level schedule (12 weeks)

Weeks 1-4: Fundamentals & Easy Problems
- Week 1: Arrays & Strings — basics, two-pointers, sliding window, sorting. Target: 20 problems.
- Week 2: Hashing & Sets, Maps — frequency counting, grouping, anagrams. Target: 20 problems.
- Week 3: Linked Lists & Stacks/Queues — reversal, merging, cycle detection, monotonic stacks. Target: 20 problems.
- Week 4: Recursion & Binary Trees (basics) — traversals, depth, simple DFS. Target: 20 problems.

Weeks 5-8: Intermediate Topics
- Week 5: Binary Trees (advanced), Heaps, Priority Queues. Target: 20 problems.
- Week 6: Backtracking & Recursion patterns (subsets, permutations, combinations). Target: 20 problems.
- Week 7: Dynamic Programming (intro) — knapsack, LIS, memoization. Target: 20 problems.
- Week 8: Graphs (BFS/DFS), Topological Sort, Shortest Paths (Dijkstra basics). Target: 20 problems.

Weeks 9-10: Advanced Topics & Systematic Review
- Week 9: Advanced DP, Bit Manipulation, Math-heavy problems. Target: 20 problems.
- Week 10: Advanced Graphs (flows, union-find), Tries, Segment Trees (overview). Target: 20 problems.

Weeks 11-12: Timed Practice & Mock Interviews
- Week 11: Timed problem sets (2-hour sessions), focus on weaknesses. 3-4 timed sessions.
- Week 12: Mock interviews (peer/platform), 6-8 mocks, review and final cheat sheets.

Daily schedule (2-3 hours/day typical)
- Warm-up (15-20 min): Review 1-2 previously solved problems, read solution notes.
- Learning (30-45 min): Read or watch focused tutorial for the day's topic.
- Practice (60-90 min): Solve 2-3 problems (one easy, one medium, maybe one hard). Time yourself for at least one problem.
- Review (15-30 min): Write a clean solution, add notes, update `tracker.md`.

Weekly cadence
- Monday: New topic intro + 1 easy problem.
- Tue-Wed: 2 practice problems + notes.
- Thu: 1-2 problems, deep read of solutions you couldn't solve.
- Fri: 1 problem + implement a clean solution in `solutions/`.
- Sat: Mock small contest (2-3 problems) or timed set.
- Sun: Review, write cheat-sheet notes, rest.

Concrete deliverables I'll add in the repo
- `tracker.md` — topic list, target counts, progress table.
- `solutions/` — language templates + solved problems organized by topic.
- `cheatsheets/` — one-page summaries for each major topic.
- `mocks/` — mock interview prompts and recordings/notes.

Resources
- Text/Video: "Elements of Programming Interviews" (selected chapters), "Grokking the Coding Interview" (patterns), William Fiset (data structures), NeetCode/Striver playlist.
- Problem sites: LeetCode, Codeforces (div2 practice), AtCoder (for speed), InterviewBit.
- Mock platforms: Pramp, Interviewing.io, peers.

Metrics & tracking
- Track problems solved per topic, time spent, success rate under timed conditions, and notes on patterns missed.
- Weekly retrospective: list three improvements and one focused action next week.

Edge cases & assumptions
- This plan assumes 2-3 hours/day availability. If you have more/less time, scale intensity (compress to 8 weeks for full-time, extend to 24 weeks for part-time).
- Language: Python recommended for rapid prototyping; add C++ templates if interviewing for systems roles.

Next steps (what I will do now)
1. Create `tracker.md` with topic rows, difficulty targets, and progress columns. (Todo item 2)
2. Create `solutions/` folder and add Python/C++ templates. (Todo item 4)
3. Curate first 100 practice problems list and add to `mocks/` and `cheatsheets/` as needed. (Todo item 3)

If you'd like, I can: generate the `tracker.md`, create starter templates in `solutions/`, and curate the first 50 problems now. Tell me which language to focus on (Python/C++/Java).
